NLTK for tagging words

2. Divide the page into sections, preferably in the ratio 25:50:25, and process the top section for buyer, seller and date, middle section for numbers/ 'Rs'/ '$' and text associated with them laterally.

3. All keywords should be in smallcaps, and convert all identified words to smallcaps, and apply autocorrect before comparing them.

4. Another alternative method which can be implemented is to select the various parts of text in an image and store those image parts in a database
